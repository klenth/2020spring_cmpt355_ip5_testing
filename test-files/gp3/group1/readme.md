# Group 1 tests

Files in this directory are ones that only the larger teams (of four students) are required to parse. **These teams
must also be able to pass the group 0 tests** â€” these are _in addition to_ the group 0 tests, not _instead of_.

As you test your parser on the files, make sure not only that it parses them, but also that the parse tree is correct;
for example, an "else" should be parsed alongside the "if" that it matches, not an earlier "if", and parse trees
should be reflective of operator precedence and associativity.
